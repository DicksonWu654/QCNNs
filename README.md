## What are QCNNs?

A Quanvolutional Neural Network (QNN) are basically a CNN but with quanvolutional layers (much like how CNN's have convolutioanl layers). A Quanvolutional layer acts and behaves just like a convolutional layer!Â

Much like a normal convolutional layer, we take a subset of the image, pass it through our kernal, and then it outputs something that'll be part of a new image.Â 

Since it acts so much like a normal Convolutional layer, you could literally use both a QNN and a CNN together in the same model!
